# Modularo
The fully modular open source keyboard from 60%-80% to 110% with multimedia controls, trackpad, LEDs and more.

# Current State
The project is on hold until I have sufficient funds to make at least one prototype. I will continue the project from time to time but I invite someone motivated to fork the project and go as far as making it. I'm also willing to help with the firmware and the software.

# History
The idea of a fully modular keyboard came to me when I wanted to change my old membrane keyboard by a mechanical one but without paying a lot of money and therefore doing it myself. This keyboard had to be small enough to be carried around but also have a lot of functionality like music controls, a numpad and macros. This repository is the whole project with the development of the software that controls it and its hardware.
